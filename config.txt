Parser for ini-style config files
=================================

Example:
---
# comments start with hash or semicolon
; and last until the end of the line
name = value ; global, ie, no section
[section]
foo = bar
flag
[section "Quux"]
foo = this is another foo
bar = "Value with #;\n nasty characters"
---

Variable names and section names will be lower-cased.
Subsection names (in double quotes) keep original casing.
Values keep original casing.
Values can be in double quotes; then they may contain
the comment chars (# and ;) or any of a few common escapes
like \n (newline) or \t (tab).

The API is designed to parse through the entire file
and call a provided callback for each name = value pair.
The name will be qualified with section and subsection (if any)
as "section.Subsection.name"; the value may be NULL, which
shall be interpreted as true.
