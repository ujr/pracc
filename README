This is pracc.

Pracc complements CUPS to do printing with accounting.
The pracc package consists of a backend for CUPS and
a few tools to manage user's printer accounts.

Be sure to read all documentation that comes with pracc.
Pracc is not plug-and-play but easy once you understand
how it works.

Compilation and installation instructions:

 1. Download the package.
 2. tar xzf pracc-version.tgz
 3. cd pracc
 5. Adjust the Makefile!
 4. make
 5. sudo make install

Once pracc is installed, you can use the pracc-check
tool to check if the installation is (still) fine.
