<h1>Printing and the Windows Firewall</h1>

<p>Windows XP, Service Pack 2 (SP2) comes with a personal firewall
 that caused us a lot of headache in conjunction with printing:
 the firewall's default settings are such that printing no longer
 works, at least with Samba as a print server!</p>

<h3>Problem Analysis</h3>
<p>Samba, implementing the Windows NT/2K <i>printer change notify</i>
 feature, tries to open a connection to the TCP ports 139/445 on the
 <i>client</i>. This additional connection is used to push asynchronous
 notifications about changes in the printer queue. Here is a typical
 picture on a print server (at IP 172.16.1.20) with a client printing
 from IP 172.16.5.46 (the first line is the connection back to the
 client):</p>
<pre># netstat -n -t -p | grep 172.16.5.46
tcp  0  0  172.16.1.20:35113  172.16.5.46:445   ESTABLISHED  26436/smbd
tcp  0  0  172.16.1.20:139    172.16.5.46:1229  ESTABLISHED  26436/smbd
</pre>
<p>If the Windows Firewall is active in its default configuration,
 then the connection from the server to the client is blocked.</p>
<p>My observation is, that Samba waits for some timeout to occur until
 it gives up on these impossible connections. Unfortunately, this timeout
 cannot be influenced in the config file (other than setting
 <tt>disable spoolss = yes</tt>, which also disables driver downloading).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, once this timeout expires, printing usually still
 does not work, but reasons are unknown. In our setup, an empty file
 appears in the Samba spooling area on the print server and on the
 client side, these jobs remain in the queue until Samba is restarted.
 Probably something goes astray with the TDB files.</p>
<p>Some more information on the implementation of the notification feature
 can be found in the <i>Samba Developer's Guide</i>, chapter 18:
 <a href="http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-Developers-Guide/devprinting.html">Samba Printing Internals</a>.</p>

<h3>Solution #1: Reconfigure the Firewall</h3>
<p>Idea (obvious): configure the firewall such that it allows
 connections from everywhere, from some subnet, or even only
 from the print server. The following Windows Batch Script
 configures the firewall to allow connections from the local
 subnet and the print server (IP 10.82.1.20):</p>
<pre>rem netsh firewall set opmode ENABLE
netsh firewall set portopening TCP 445 Microsoft-ds ENABLE custom 10.82.1.20,LocalSubnet
netsh firewall set portopening TCP 139 NetBIOS-ssn ENABLE custom 10.82.1.20,LocalSubnet
</pre>
<p>These lines open ports <b>tcp/445</b> (Microsoft-DS) and <b>tcp/139</b>
 (NetBIOS session) for inbound connections from IP address 10.82.1.20 (our
 print server) and the local subnet. You can do the same using the GUI,
 if you so desire.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these settings do not seem to work in practice!
 A bug in the firewall? In fact, we only managed to solve the
 firewall/printing problem by opening these two ports to connections
 from everywhere:</p>
<pre>rem netsh firewall set opmode ENABLE
netsh firewall set portopening TCP 445 Microsoft-ds ENABLE all
netsh firewall set portopening TCP 139 NetBIOS-ssn ENABLE all
</pre>
<p>Note that both batch scripts affect only the <i>current profile</i>
 of the firewall. The latter script can be downloaded as
 <a href="wxp2prt.bat">wxp2prt.bat</a>.</p>

<h3>Solution #2: Disable the Firewall</h3>
<p>This may leave you with an uneasy feeling... so prefer the
 first solution.</p> 
<p>After disabling the Windows Firewall, go to the &quot;Security
 Center&quot; and make sure that it does no longer monitor firewall
 settings! Otherwise re-enabling it isn't any farther away than an
 angry click on a nasty bubble in the lower right part of your screen.</p>

<h3>What about the network?</h3>
<p>Make sure that connections from the print server to
 ports <b>tcp/445</b> and <b>tcp/139</b> on the clients
 are allowed (check your routers and firewalls).</p>

<h3>What about other firewalls?</h3>
<p>Other personal firewalls for Windows (Symantec, Zone Alarm, etc)
 seem to also block the critical ports by default.
 Configure them appropriately.</p>

<h3>About the Windows XP SP2 Firewall</h3>
<p>Besides the GUI configuration dialog box, there is also a command
 line tool that comes with Windows XP and can be used to fiddle about
 with the firewall: <b>netsh</b>. It can also do some other network
 stuff. Try <b>netsh help</b> at a command prompt.</p>
<p>Windows Firewall supports two different profiles: <b>StandardProfile</b>
 and <b>DomainProfile</b>. Using <b>netsh</b>, settings can be made
 for either profile or for both.</p>
<p>Windows Firewall appears to store its settings in the <b>registry</b>
 under the key <b>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SharedAccess\Parameters\FirewallPolicy</b>.
 There is a sub-key for each profile.
 Note that the SP1 firewall used a different location in the registry!</p>
<p>Windows Firewall can be configured to log dropped packets
 as well as established connections to a file. This is quite
 useful for analysis! (However, I didn't get the logging of
 dropped packets to work.)
 Use a tool like <a href="http://ophilipp.free.fr/op_tail.htm">mtail</a>
 to get a life view on the log as it grows.</p>
