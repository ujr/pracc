<h1>Printer Accounting</h1>

<p>Printer accounting means to count who printed how much
(and where and when). This information is useful for statistics
and for charging printing costs to those who caused them.
The unit of the counting is usually pages; some elaborate
systems also include ink coverage.</p>

<p>There are two principles for charging costs:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Credit:</b> a user can always print but gets a bill
 every once in a while; the bill could also go to the
 organizational unit to which the user belongs.</li>
<li><b>Debit:</b> a user can only print as long as there
 is a minimal balance on some &quot;printing account&quot;,
 if the account balance is below this value, printing is
 denied.</li>
</ol>
<p>The debit principle is ideal for students, the credit
principle is more appropriate for staff members.</p>

<h2>The Pracc System</h2>

<p>Pracc is the name of a collection of conventions and tools
for printing with accounting. Specifically, pracc consists of</p>
<ul>
<li>a backend for CUPS (<a href="http://www.cups.org/">www.cups.org</a>)
<li>a web interface for administration (called <i>pracc.cgi</i>),
<li>a number of command-line tools for administration, and
<li>a file format for the individual printing accounts.
</ul>

<p>Pracc maintains a <i>printing account</i> per user who is
subject to printer accounting. Optionally, group accounts
can also be created and used by pracc. Printing accounts are
simple plain-text files, so-called <i>pracc files</i>. 
For consistency, they should be modified only using the
tools supplied with pracc. Each account works after the
credit principle (unlimited printing) or the debit principle
(printing only allowed until some minimal balance is reached).
Accounts can be changed between the two billing principles.</p>

<p>The CUPS backend replaces the standalone programs <i>netprint</i>
and <i>print</i> of earlier versions. It sends print jobs to printers
on the network using the &quot;AppSocket&quot; (aka &quot;JetDirect&quot;
or &quot;Port 9100&quot;) protocol, which is supported by almost
all network printers today. The backend only sends the print job
if the job originator has enough credits. While printing,
the backend tries to figure out how many pages are printed
and charges the costs for those pages to the job originator's
printing account.</p>

<h2>Technical Background on Printer Accounting</h2>

<p>Printers have not been designed with accounting in mind.
There is no standard protocol for sending print jobs
to a printer <em>and</em> having the printer reply with the
number of pages printed (or the amount of ink used).</p>

<p>However, most printers can tell when it is time to replace
the ink and how many pages they printed since having left the
factory. The latter is implemented as a hardware register that
is incremented for each page printed. It can be read using
PostScript and/or PJL (but it cannot be changed other than
by printing pages). This feature can be used for page counting.
The PJL language, if supported by a printer, has a feature
that reports the number of pages printed by a print job.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, both methods of page counting have problems.
When using PostScript to read the page counter there is no way
of determining when a print job has finished printing. To work
around this problem, the page counter is read repeatedly till
it stabilises, but this tends to slow down printing.
Further, timeout and network problems can afflict both methods
by disrupting communication between host and printer before
the final pagecount could be read. As a result, <b>printer
accounting is never 100% accurate</b>. Bear this in mind.</p>

<p>A problem specific to the &quot;debit&quot; approach to
charging printing costs to users is that the resources used
by a print job are available only after the job was printed,
hence not at the time when we ought to decide whether or not
this user should be allowed to print at all.</p>

<p>So why not use a software to <b>count the pages in the print
job?</b> Wouldn't that also fix the problems mentioned above?
Commercial printer accounting solutions use this approach.
But what seems to be a simple and obvious solution has
serious problems: such software uses resources on
the server (especially CPU cycles), is usually <u>easy to defeat</u>
by the gifted user, is an <u>attractive way to break into a system</u>,
and last but not least: the number of pages in a print job is
not the number of pages actually printed. Since counting pages
in a print job tends to count more pages than get printed
(think of paper jams), you are bound to get complaints...</p>

<p>My present implementation tries to determine both, the pages
in the job and the pages actually printed, and uses whatever
information is available when billing an account.</p>
