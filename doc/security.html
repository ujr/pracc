<h1>The Pracc Security Concept</h1>

<p>Pracc files are protected from arbitrary access by giving
them a specific owner <tt>PRACCOWNER</tt> and a specific group
<tt>PRACCGROUP</tt>. Pracc files have mode 0660; they need not
be world-readable.</p>

<p>Programs that need to access pracc files are: the <b>backend</b>,
the <b>web interface</b> <i>pracc.cgi</i>, and a number of command
line <b>tools</b>.

<p>The web interface uses two system groups to control pracc
file operations: users in the group <tt>PRACCPEEK</tt> can view
all pracc files but cannot change anything; users in the group
<tt>PRACCPOKE</tt> can perform all administrative actions:
creating, deleting, purging, editing, and viewing accounts.</p>

<h3>Suggested Setup</h3>

<p>The pracc backend shall be run as <i>root</i> by the CUPS
scheduler. This is achieved by installing the backend with
mode 0700.</p>

<p>For the web interface, there are two options: (1) add the
user as which the web server runs to the group <tt>PRACCGROUP</tt>
or (2) configure the web server such that it executes the pracc
web interface <i>pracc.cgi</i> as user <tt>PRACCOWNER</tt> or
as group <tt>PRACCGROUP</tt>.</p>

<p>For the command line tools, no special measures have to be
taken. It is assumed that only those users execute them, that
already have appropriate permissions to access pracc files.</p>

<h3>Configuration and Defaults</h3>

<dl>
<dt><tt>PRACCOWNER</tt> (default: <i>root</i>)</dt>
<dd>Owner for pracc files. The default is fine.</dd>
<dt><tt>PRACCGROUP</tt> (default: <i>lpadmin</i>)</dt>
<dd>Group for pracc files.
 Prefer a dedicated group over the default.</dd>
<dt><tt>PRACCPEEK</tt> (default: <i>pracc-watch</i>)</dt>
<dd>Group of users that are allowed to observe,
 but not change, anything in the pracc system.</dd>
<dt><tt>PRACCPOKE</tt> (default: <i>pracc-admin</i>)</dt>
<dd>Group of users that are allowed to observe <em>and</em> change
anything in the pracc system.</dd>
</dl>

<p>These values can be changed prior to compilation by editing
the <i>Makefile</i> in the source directory. After installation,
the <i>pracc-check</i> command line tool can be used to check
if the actual file permissions correspond to those configured.</p>
