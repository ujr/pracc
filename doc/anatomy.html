<h1>Anatomy of the Printing System (outdated)</h1>

<p>We need one special user:<br>
 <b>pracc</b> to own accounting-related files (do <em>not</em> use lp)</p>
<p>We need two special groups:<br>
 <b>pracc</b> for accounting-related stuff (do <em>not</em> use lp)<br>
 <b>print</b> to own printing-related stuff (you may use lp)</p>

<p>All printing and accounting stuff is in <i>/var/print</i>
 with one exception: <i>/etc/printers</i> is the config file.
 It is useful if <i>/var/print/bin</i> is in your $PATH.</p>
<pre>
/var/print                     755 root:root    container for everything
/var/print/bin                 775 root:root    print and pracc binaries
/var/print/cgi                 775 root:root    web site, cgi scripts (optional)
/var/print/doc                 775 root:root    print and pracc documentation
/var/print/spool              1777 root:root    where Samba spools files
&nbsp;
/var/print/status             2775 root:print   printer log files (per printer)
/var/print/status/PRINTER.log  660 root:print   log file for PRINTER
&nbsp;
/var/print/output             3775 root:print   print job output (per user)
/var/print/output/USER.out     660 USER:print   prune (or divert to /dev/null)
&nbsp;
/var/print/pracc              2770 pracc:print  where pracc files reside
/var/print/pracc/USER          660 pracc:print  pracc file for user USER
/var/print/pracc.log           660 root:pracc   log of important pracc transactions
</pre>

<p>Samba stuff is located in <i>/var/samba</i>:</p>
<pre>
/var/samba                     775 root:root
/var/samba/bin                 755 root:root    Samba-specific tools and scripts
/var/samba/conf                775 root:root    Convenience: symlinks to Samba configs
/var/samba/logs -&gt; /var/log/samba               Convenience: symlink to Samba logs
/var/samba/shares              775 root:root    Samba shares:-
/var/samba/shares/print$       775 root:Print Operators   \\server\print$ 
/var/samba/shares/drivers     2775 root:Print Operators   \\server\drivers 
</pre>
<p>When Samba invokes the <i>print command</i>, it does so
 as the user that is authenticated on that printer share.</p>

<h3>Recurring Tasks</h3>
<p>In principle, a print/pracc system does not need any recurring jobs.<br>
 In practice, however, the following jobs may prove useful:</p>
<pre>
# <b>purge print spool queue</b>
01 00 * * *  root  find /var/print/spool -exec rm '{}' \;
&nbsp;
# <b>kill pending connections: restart Samba</b>
02 00 * * *  root  /etc/init.d/smb stop
03 00 * * *  root  /etc/init.d/smb start
&nbsp;
# <b>set time</b> from a reliable time server
04 00 * * *  root  /usr/sbin/ntpdate swisstime.ethz.ch &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
&nbsp;
# <b>correct permissions</b> (substitute <i>print</i>)
# they are frequently forgotten on updates...
05 * * * *  root  chgrp <i>print</i> /var/print/bin/print &amp;&amp; chmod 2775 /var/print/bin/print
&nbsp;
# <b>create monthly statements of printer usage etc</b>
# 0 6 1 * *  root  /some/script/of/your/making
# 5 6 1 * *  root  /another/script/you/provide
</pre>

<h3>Setting up Samba</h3>
<p>By default, users have no account and this means free printing.
 The most convenient way to create accounts is to use Samba's
 <b>root preexec</b> feature:</p>
<pre>root preexec = /var/print/bin/makepracc.sh %u</pre>
<p>where <b>makepracc.sh</b> is a simple script that determines how much
 initial credit and what limit a user <i>%u</i> should get and then creates
 such an account using <a href="pracc-tools.html">pracc-init</a> with the
 <b>-F</b> option.</p>
<p>Printer shares should should look roughly like that:</p>
<pre>[speedy-print]
  comment = Our Speedy Printer
  path = /var/print/spool
  printable = yes
  print command = /var/print/bin/print.sh %p %s
  lpq command = /var/print/bin/pseudo-lpq.sh -P %p
</pre>
<p>where <b>print.sh</b> is a simple script, for example:</p>
<pre>#!/bin/sh
# To be used as Samba's <b>print command</b>: print the job,
# remove it from disk if printing is successful, log everything
# to <i>/tmp/print.log</i>, and do all that in the background.
&nbsp;
LOGFILE=/tmp/print.log
PRINTER="$1"
shift
(/var/print/bin/print "$PRINTER" $* &amp;&amp; rm -f $*) &gt;&gt; $LOGFILE 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;
</pre>
<p>There are many alternatives. You could generate a <i>/etc/printcap</i>
 file and then use Samba's <b>load printers</b> feature. And if you don't
 like the <b>print command</b> to be a script, you could simply use:</p>
<pre>/var/print/bin/print %p %s &amp;&amp; rm -f %s</pre>

<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>The printing system consists of a bunch of small software tools
 that are documented individually:
 <a href="../netprint/netprint.html">netprint</a> is the low-level
 driver program that is invoked by <a href="print.html">print</a>
 but is also useful individually, mainly for testing; print reads
 its configuration from <i>/etc/printers</i>, but this config file
 can also be inspected with <a href="printconf.html">printconf</a>.
 Finally, accounting is done with the <a href="pracc-tools.html">
 pracc tools</a> and makes use of <a href="pracc-files.html">pracc
 files</a>. However, <a href="print.html">print</a> directly reads
 and writes pracc files.</p>
